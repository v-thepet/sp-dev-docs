## Overview of Task Actions in SharePoint Designer 2013

A task in SharePoint is used to assign work to a person or group and then track the progress of that work over time. There are two workflow actions in SharePoint Designer 2013 designed for working with tasks.
These actions are:

- **Assign a task** is used to create a SharePoint task and assign it to a single participant.
- **Start a task process** is used to assign a task to multiple participants.

The Task Actions are accessed in the **Action** drop-down menu of the SharePoint Designer 2013 ribbon, as shown in the figure.

## Using Task Actions in SharePoint

A business process often consists of tasks that must be performed by people. A workflow orchestrates the steps of a process. A workflow uses Task Actions to assign tasks to people. For example, when a new employee is hired a number of tasks need to be performed. One such task might be a new employee orientation. The task might need to be performed by a member of the Human Resources department.

#### Figure: The Assign a task action in SharePoint Designer 2013

The **Assign a task** and **Start a task process** actions are located on the **Actions** drop-down menu in the SharePoint Designer 2013 ribbon. You can add the actions to your workflow and then customize them for your particular circumstance. The **Assign a task** action is used to assign a task to a single participant. The **Start a task process** action is used to assign a task to multiple participants.

### Assign a task

The **Assign a task** action is shown in the figure.

The **Assign a task** action takes three inputs: the user to assign a task, the outcome variable, and the task id variable.

- **this user**: Opens the **Assign a Task** dialog as shown in the figure. Use the dialog to set the participant, task title, description, due date, task options, email options, and outcome options.
- **Variable: Outcome**: Assigns the variable that will hold the outcome of the task.
- **Variable: TaskID**: Assigns the variable that will hold the id of the task.
