## SharePoint workflow object model
<a name="bk_SPwfom"> </a>

The SharePoint object model is built on top of the .NET Framework 4 object model for Windows Workflow Foundation 4, but with innovations that enable workflow functionality in SharePoint generally, and in SharePoint Add-ins in particular. The native .NET Framework 4 object model for Windows Workflow Foundation 4 is located in the .NET Framework  [System.Workflow namespaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg145026.aspx).
  
    
    
One way to think of the SharePoint workflow object model is as a set of workflow services. There are four services: 
  
    
    

- **Instance management service:** Manages workflow instances and their execution.
    
  
- **Deployment service:** Manages the deployment of workflow definitions.
    
  
- **Interop service:** Manages the interop bridge for supporting legacy workflows.
    
  
- **Messaging service:** Manages message queuing and transport.
    
  

### SharePoint workflow namespaces

The SharePoint workflow object model, on the other hand, is contained in ten namespaces: five of them are SharePoint namespaces, and five others are Microsoft Office namespaces.
  
    
    
 **Microsoft.SharePoint** namespaces:
  
    
    

-  [Microsoft.SharePoint.Workflow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.SharePoint.Workflow.aspx)
